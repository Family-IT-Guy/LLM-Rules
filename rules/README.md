## Customization

Feel free to modify these rules to fit your specific needs:

- **Add domain-specific requirements** (e.g., medical, legal, financial)
- **Adjust response length preferences** 
- **Include specific methodologies** (e.g., SWOT analysis, design thinking)
- **Add industry-specific terminology** and frameworks

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific in your questions** - Rules encourage the AI to ask for clarification
2. **Provide context upfront** - Include relevant background information  
3. **Expect more back-and-forth** - AI will validate assumptions before proceeding
4. **Document your conversations** - Structured approaches produce reusable insights
5. **Combine with frameworks** - Use rules with structured frameworks like our [Thinking Partner](../frameworks/thinking-partner-consultant.md)
