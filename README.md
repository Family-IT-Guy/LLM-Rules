# LLM Rules & Frameworks

A collection of carefully crafted rules and frameworks to dramatically improve the behavior and usefulness of Large Language Models (LLMs). These rules transform your AI assistant into a rigorous thinking partner that validates assumptions, applies first-principles reasoning, and provides evidence-based analysis.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Find your platform** below
2. **Copy the rules** for your LLM
3. **Paste them** into your LLM's configuration  
4. **Optional:** Use our [Thinking Partner Framework](#frameworks) for structured analysis

## 📋 Platform Rules

### Claude Desktop
- **[Claude Desktop Rules](rules/claude-desktop.md)** - Core analytical rules
- **[Claude Desktop with MCP](rules/claude-desktop-mcp.md)** - Rules with MCP tool integration

**Setup:** Settings → Profile → "What personal preferences should Claude consider in responses?"

### ChatGPT 
- **[ChatGPT Web Rules](rules/chatgpt-web.md)** - Thinking partner rules

**Setup:** Customize ChatGPT → "What traits should ChatGPT have?"

## 🧠 Frameworks

### Thinking Partner & Business Consultant
A comprehensive 4-phase framework for structured problem-solving and decision-making.

**[→ View Framework](frameworks/thinking-partner-consultant.md)**

**What it provides:**
- Structured approach to complex problems
- Systematic assumption validation
- Evidence-based decision making
- Downloadable documentation of your thinking process

**Use with any platform** - works with all rule sets above.

## ⚡ What These Rules Do

### Core Transformations
- **Assumption Validation:** Requires evidence before accepting ideas
- **First-Principles Thinking:** Breaks down problems to fundamentals
- **Problem-First Approach:** Confirms problems exist before solving them
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** Demands proof for all claims
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Addresses underlying issues, not symptoms

### Response Style Changes
- **Direct Communication:** Eliminates fluff and unnecessary padding
- **Structured Analysis:** Applies systematic approaches to complex problems
- **Clarifying Questions:** Requests specifics instead of making assumptions
- **Quality Focus:** Prioritizes accuracy and thoroughness

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Before Rules
**User:** "Help me build a mobile app"  
**AI:** "Great idea! I'd be happy to help. Let's start with choosing a framework..."

### After Rules  
**User:** "Help me build a mobile app"  
**AI:** "I need to understand the problem first. What specific problem are you trying to solve? Who is your target user? What evidence do you have that this problem needs solving?"
