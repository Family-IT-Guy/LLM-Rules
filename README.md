# LLM Rules & Frameworks

A collection of carefully crafted rules and frameworks to dramatically improve the behavior and usefulness of Large Language Models (LLMs). These rules transform your AI assistant into a rigorous thinking partner that validates assumptions, applies first-principles reasoning, and provides evidence-based recommendations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Choose your platform** from the options below
2. **Copy the rules** for your LLM platform  
3. **Paste them** into your LLM's configuration
4. **Optional:** Use our [Thinking Partner Framework](#frameworks) for structured analysis

## 📋 Platform-Specific Rules

### Claude Desktop
**Best for:** Complex analysis, problem-solving, and technical work

- **[Claude Desktop Rules](rules/claude-desktop.md)** - Standard analytical rules
- **[Claude Desktop with MCP](rules/claude-desktop-mcp.md)** - Enhanced rules with tool integration

**Setup:** Settings → Profile → "What personal preferences should Claude consider in responses?"

### ChatGPT 
**Best for:** Consulting-style conversations and ideation

- **[ChatGPT Web Rules](rules/chatgpt-web.md)** - Consultant and thinking partner rules

**Setup:** Customize ChatGPT → "What traits should ChatGPT have?"

## 🧠 Frameworks

### Thinking Partner & Business Consultant
A comprehensive 4-phase framework that turns your LLM into a structured business consultant and thinking partner.

**[→ View Framework](frameworks/thinking-partner-consultant.md)**

**What it does:**
- Guides you through structured problem-solving
- Validates assumptions with evidence
- Creates actionable business plans
- Maintains a downloadable running log

**Use cases:**
- Business strategy and planning  
- Product development decisions
- Career planning and major life choices
- Investment and opportunity analysis

## ⚡ What These Rules Do

### Core Transformations
- **Assumption Validation:** Never accepts ideas without evidence
- **First-Principles Thinking:** Breaks down problems to fundamentals
- **Problem-First Approach:** Confirms problems exist before solving them
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** Requires proof for all claims
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Addresses underlying issues, not symptoms

### Response Style Changes
- **Direct Communication:** No fluff, padding, or unnecessary apologies
- **Structured Analysis:** Systematic approach to complex problems
- **Clarifying Questions:** Asks for specifics instead of assuming
- **Quality Focus:** Prioritizes accuracy over speed

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Before Rules
**User:** "Help me build a mobile app"  
**AI:** "Great idea! I'd be happy to help. Let's start with choosing a framework..."

### After Rules  
**User:** "Help me build a mobile app"  
**AI:** "I need to understand the problem first. What specific problem are you trying to solve? Who is your target user? What evidence do you have that this problem needs solving?"
